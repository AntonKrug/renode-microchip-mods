# renode-microchip-mods

This is a repository for placing source snapshots of Antmicro's [Renode](https://renode.io/) which are used to build SoftConsole's Renode and can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/AntonKrug/renode-microchip-mods/releases).

This repository doesn't have any commits and the [release page](https://github.com/AntonKrug/renode-microchip-mods/releases) is the only way to obtain the sources (git clone will not work).

Because this is a full snapshot, no futher submodules are required and there is no need to initialize submodules. The build requirements are described in the [Renode's documentation](https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
